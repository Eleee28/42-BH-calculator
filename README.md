42 XP and blackhole days calculator

Due to the development cease of the website 42Evaluators, I was left without an XP and BH days calculator so I decided to create my own.

## About the project

This is a simple calculator to obtain the blackhole days given by a project, taking into account your current level in the cursus.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository and go to the java folder
2. Run ```make r``` to compile and execute the project

## Credits

I found all the necessary information regarding the blackhole and experience in a blog written a fellow student ([link](https://medium.com/@benjaminmerchin/42-black-hole-deep-dive-cbc4b343c6b2)).
